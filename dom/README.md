This library inserts annotations into an HTML page by utilizing the DOM/Node interfaces directly instead of manipulating the HTML string for the entire document's body, although there's still some HTML string manipulation in there.

This package is not finished and does not currently work properly. There are still a lot of technical issues that need to be solved in order for this to work and that is why it was ultimately abandoned. It was copied directly out of xyAnnotations' codebase before its system was changed and no modifications have been made.

It is possible that this code will be revisited in the future. Feel free to finish its development and submit a pull request.
